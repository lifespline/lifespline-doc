# About

Coding is a *way of life*, i.e., it is an activity a person dedicates his/her's life to. The activity has a set of principles that enables the **developer** to be extraordinarily happy by dedicating his/her life to this activity. The [manifest](#the-manifest) contains a non-exhaustive set of principles for *Coding*.

# The Manifest

## Play

It's fundamental to let **play** drive the coding. It's through play that the developer master its' craft.

### Example 1 - Promises, promises...

Learning to use the AWS SDK V3 JS, I came accross the notion of `promises` and then `asyn/await` + `Promise.then.catch` patterns. It was great dedicating some time to play with it to get a good grasp of what it is. If I'm doing [time-driven-development](#time-driven-development), I could never play without a guilty consciousness. Play requires [serenity-and-focus](#serenity-and-focus).

## Agile

## You Are Not Binary

## Curiosity Killed The Cat

Too much curiosity can lead to [burnout](#burnout). It's preferable to add the curiosity to a file (ex.: `praxis.md`) with a `TODO` and go back to it afterwards, and stick to the layed out plan meanwhile. Also, [context-changing-is-expensive](#context-changing-is-expensive)).

[⌂ home](#about) / [the-manifest](#the-manifest)

## Rebels Die Young

You're very seldom justified to neglect the principles of this framework. If you feel you are entitled to do it, you're likely approaching [burnout](#burnout).

[⌂ home](#about) / [the-manifest](#the-manifest)

## Burnout

Never do **nothing but coding**, this causes you to burnout. Dedicate most of your time to coding, but do other activities like sports, being with friends, *etc.* It's very important that you **switch contexts** (see [context-changing-is-expensive](#context-changing-is-expensive)). Burnout causes you to loose [serenity-and-focus](#serenity-and-focus) for days. You can identify you're approaching burnout with the signs:

- You're justified to neglect the principles of this framework
- You start enjoying injecting more time and more time into tasks
- You let your curiosity overwrite the plan
- You're working and disregarding distracting factors like: headache, backpain, bad lighting, noisy music on the headset, *etc.*
- Your reality is becoming the code characters. The commits. The browser. The successful builds. The *improving just this one thing more*, the going into coding for 11 hours straight, feeling detached from the real world, neglecting your body, your eyes, your friends and loved ones. When you start feeling you are digital, when you start feeling nothing else matters, you've burnt out.

If you feel any of these signs, switch to an activity like sports, being with friends, *etc.*, and get back to coding when you feel you've had enough of it [you-cant-be-unhappy-without-being-unhappy](#you-cant-be-unhappy-without-being-unhappy)

### Example 1

Put so much time into learning CDK the week before for the interview monday, I could work no more on sunday. I begin not caring It's 23:00 and I'm writing this principle in hopes that this won't happen often in the future.

[⌂ home](#about) / [the-manifest](#the-manifest)

## You Can't Be Unhappy Without Being Unhappy

Not coding can feel meaningless, chaotic and miserable. Rescue yourself from that situation by escaping to a nice room with a nice computer and a nice internet connection.

[⌂ home](#about) / [the-manifest](#the-manifest)

## Over The Shoulders Of Giants

Never **reinvent the wheel**. The less code, the better [loc-and-refactoring](#loc-and-refactoring). Choose to walk *on the shoulders of giants*, but focus on the engineering to integrate those technologies. If you got fast and well where you wanted to, - great -, you were given time to work on something more important!

### Example 1

I wanted to learn how to build and deploy and maintain a website from scratch. My approach is always a philosophical one, or a mathematical one: always start from the axioms. There's no need for this. Tech is a world without beginning and without an end. It's all in the process. Googling the fastest frameworks to build, deploy and maintain a website.

[⌂ home](#about) / [the-manifest](#the-manifest)

## Serenity And Focus

Writing code is a creative and a learning activity. It requires a fair amount of constant focus, and focus requires serenity. These two forces provoke happiness.

### .git

Having your solutions pushed to a remote server provide **serenity**. Without a remote server, you can never trust your local copy will survive and eventuality.

#### Example 1

I was on the wrong AWS profile, that's why the lambda wasn't showing up on the list. I was relaxed however, I knew things had deployed through code, so it would simply be a matter of redeploying the solution.

### SDK

Having your solutions written in code provide **serenity**. Without the SDK, you can never trust recovering from a manual deployment.

#### Example 1

I was on the wrong AWS profile, that's why the lambda wasn't showing up on the list. I was relaxed however, I knew things had deployed through code, so it would simply be a matter of redeploying the solution.

## Coding

In the future we'll have devices reading biometric signals and outputting code based on our thoughts. For now, we have to use our hand fingers to insert code characters in a source file. The keyboard is a device adapted to our human hands. Typing is a very cumbersome and slow process, so it's very important to choose a great quality keyboard.

In the future we'll have AR devices in controlled environments showing the code based in an incredibly immersive and 3D UX. For now, all the information is shown in **windows** on a LED wall called a monitor. Moving windows around is very cumbersome

## Context Changing Is Expensive

It's very expensive to change contexts, avoid this if possible. **It's not worth it multi-tasking. On the long run, the productivity decreases**, but mind [burnout](#burnout).

[⌂ home](#about) / [the-manifest](#the-manifest)

### Example 1

I was wokring on documentation, and I receive an email regarding a check on the logic of a dataset. The email had two paragraphs. Reading the email alone required changing contexts. I did it, but now I'm out of the task I was doing before, and I can go back to it immediately, but I feel a sort of **fatigue** being exerted upon me simply by changing contexts. **It's not worth it multi-tasking. On the long run, the productivity decreases**.

[⌂ home](#about) / [the-manifest](#the-manifest) / [context-changing-is-expensive](#context-changing-is-expensive)

## Remote Is Heaven

### .git

Never leave your local changes unstaged and unpushed. Its preferable to unstage them from the current branch and stage them onto a pushed new temporary branch.

## Semantic Versioning

## Log Your Changes

## Squash Your Past

Sometimes different commits are relative to the same component. If you're persisting the commit history, it's best to `squash` the related commits before finishing the feature. See: [versioning-and-control](#versioning-and-control)

## Humanity

### Open-Source Community, Democracy, Freedom, Responsability


## The Ocham's Razor

## Versioning And Control

## Eh... What's up, Doc?

Document, document, document. For the sake of the community (clients), for the sake of your own understanding and your [serenity-and-focus](#serenity-and-focus), for the sake of [automation](#automation).

## Don't Multiply Beyond Necessity

### .git

Commit titles should be systematic and converge to a finite list of possible values.

### LOC And Refactoring

Abstain from having the same logic twice in the same file. Unless unpractical, abstain from having the same logic twice in your project. Unless unpractical, abstain from having the same logic twice in all the projects you'll work with in the course of your career.

[⌂ home](#about) / [the-manifest](#the-manifest)

## See-To-Believe

When you're learning something, **don't read and believe**, you'd rather **see to believe**. Technology is not science, systems are hardly deterministic. When you're learning, always do a POC on the side to verify what's really working.

Ideally, you'd then merge this knowledge with your existing knowledge by creating an industry-standardized demo, and you would contribute to the open-src technology at least with an issue, at the best with a PR.

### Example 1

I wasn't succeeding on deploying a nodejs docker image (`ENTRYPOINT ["handler.handler"]`) to an AWS ECR registry with a TS app and executing the container successfully from an AWS lambda. I was exporting the app's function `async handler` as a `default export handler;` and the lambda would keep throwing the error:

```
handler.handler not in $PATH
```

I thought of giving up, *'It's OK, you're almost there, just focus on something else now.'*. Sometimes these are words of wisdom, but frequently they will force you to don't come up with a solution, and you'll never feel you've **Seen-To-Believe**, you won't feel **ownership on the knowledge** you've adquired.

## Love-Averse: A History Of Decoupling

If a component seems to be decoupable, affect some time to decouple it. Examples:

### Example 1

Working on `hawk-ts-template`, I thought of adding some demos to the repo as to help people getting started with the template/bootstrap. As the examples became more complex, it immediately became apparent the examples should not reside in the repo itself, but on separate repos (I even began adding a script what would reset the repo once forked+cloned, and a README.md pointing out which values precisely would need/could change to automate the bootstrapping of a new project). I immediately submitted an **issue** to `hawk-ts-template` in hopes that the work would be completed sometime soon.

[⌂ home](#about) / [the-manifest](#the-manifest) / [love-averse](#love-averse)

## Beauty

Beauty is balance, power, efficacy, elegance. This is what guides the developer, not the end-result. The balance, the power, the efficacy, the elegance of process - and as a consequence - of the solution.

[⌂ home](#about) / [the-manifest](#the-manifest)

## Automation

Automation is one of the pillars of the manifest.

### .git

Having your solutions pushed to a remote server provides [serenity-and-focus](#serenity-and-focus). Without a remote server, you can never trust your local copy will survive any eventuality.

### doc

Documentation is a form of automation because it persists the extremely valuable high-level knowledge a developer retains when it is working on the solution. This knowledge deteriorates as time stars counting from the moment the developer last worked on the solution. See: [eh-whats-up-doc](#eh-whats-up-doc)

#### Example 1

I was on the wrong AWS profile, that's why the lambda wasn't showing up on the list. I was relaxed however, I knew things had deployed through code, so it would simply be a matter of redeploying the solution.

### SDK

Having your solutions written in code provide **serenity**. Without the SDK, you can never trust recovering from a manual deployment.

#### Example 1

I was on the wrong AWS profile, that's why the lambda wasn't showing up on the list. I was relaxed however, I knew things had deployed through code, so it would simply be a matter of redeploying the solution.

## Time-Driven-Development

It's an awful thing. Not unless somebody/something crucially depends on it, and nobody else can/is assigned to do it but you, - **never code with regards to time**. Coding is not meant to produce, coding is a way of life: **The Way Of The Developer**. Beautifully functional software is a product of **enjoying the process of writing code**, not a product of **trying to deliver the solution on time and according to the specs**.

[⌂ home](#about) / [the-manifest](#the-manifest)

### Example 1

A way I can get out of the stress of the **Time-Driven-Development** is to:
- allocate almost all my time to the activity of development
- get rid of the tasks at work ASAP without compromising too much on quality
- get rid of all compromises in life ASAP without hurting my loved ones
- My work is mine, my company's work is my company's
